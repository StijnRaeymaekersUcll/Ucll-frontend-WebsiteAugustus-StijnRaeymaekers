      <h2>About Eventwise</h2>
      <p>
        Eventwise is a Leuven-based crew collective dedicated to making great
        events feel effortless. We know that behind every smooth experience is
        careful preparation, clear communication, and a team that truly cares.
        Our crew is trained in safety, hospitality, and logistics — and we’re
        continuing to grow. Founded by Dirk Raeymaekers, Eventwise was created
        to make coordinating volunteers for the City of Leuven’s many events
        simpler, smoother, and more enjoyable for everyone involved. From local
        festivals to large-scale city gatherings, we bring people together to
        keep the show running seamlessly.
