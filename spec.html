      <h2>Site Specification</h2>
      <p><strong>Student:</strong> Stijn Raeymaekers</p>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        This site is for <strong>Eventwise</strong>, a Leuven based crew
        collective. We work with festivals, sports events and cultural nights to
        provide trained crew. The website shows what we do, which events are
        coming up, and gives people an easy way to apply. It should feel clear
        and simple, but also professional.
      </p>

      <h3>Client / Subject</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Client:</strong> Eventwise</li>
        <li><strong>Title:</strong> Eventwise — For Eventcrew Leuven</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Purpose:</strong> Recruit new crew and show upcoming events
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Target audience:</strong> Mainly students and young people in
          Leuven who want event work, and organizers who want to see what we do
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        Eventwise coordinates crew for all kinds of events in Leuven. We cover
        roles like hospitality, bar, stage and site crew. We care about
        inclusiveness, sustainability and quality, but also that working is fun.
        On the site we highlight our values, the type of jobs, and the events
        where people can help out. It’s written from the view of the organizers,
        talking directly to possible crew.
      </p>

      <h3>Focus</h3>
      <p>
        The focus is on keeping things short and easy to find. Events get their
        own cards with dates, roles and a button to apply. The join page has a
        clear form that asks about availability and roles. Text is kept light,
        so people don’t need to scroll through too much.
      </p>

      <h3>Existing website</h3>
      <p>
        There is no real Eventwise site right now. If there was one, a new
        version would mainly improve mobile use and make applying smoother.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <ul>

      <h3>Other notes</h3>
      <p>
        The site is built with HTML and CSS only, using CSS grid for layout.
        Colors and spacing are set with variables. The footer is fixed and the
        design is responsive so it also works on mobile. The form uses semantic
        HTML with labels and fieldsets for accessibility.
